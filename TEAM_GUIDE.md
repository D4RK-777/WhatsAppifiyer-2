## WhatsApp Business Messaging Guidelines

### Message Categories

Always use the correct terminology and understand the differences between message types:

1. **Service Messages**

- Use formatting (bold, italic, etc.) sparingly and purposefully
- Ensure preview renders correctly in the WhatsApp interface

## Communication Guidelines

### Team Communication

- Use the designated team chat for quick questions and updates
- Use video calls for complex discussions or problem-solving

- Assign priority levels appropriately
- Link related PRs to issues

### Documentation

- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Document API changes, new features, and configuration options
- Keep the README up-to-date
- Document known issues and workarounds

## Logging and Monitoring

### Using the Logging System
